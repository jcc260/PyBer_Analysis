# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Lastly, we compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this project, we took it a step further and created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot.

## Results
From the summary data frame, we can infer from the data, a trend between how populated a city is and the total number of rides, which directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. Although the total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities become farther from urbanized areas, the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. This can be explained by the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas will may lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase when supply is low.

With the multiple-line chart, we are able to compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. The number of rides seem peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March. All the graphs tend to follow the same trend throughout these months, except for the trend in suburban cities, where we see a sharper increase during the month of April.

## Summary
My first recommnendation is to shift some drivers from ubran areas to rural areas so that we can decrease the fare of the rides. We should insentivizeh the drivers to go out there so that people are not waiting too long for a driver. We should give drivers an extra bonus for every ride they take on in rural areas.
My second recommendation is study why suburban fares spike up during April. We can use that stratgey so that we can make it more consistent througout the year. If successful, we use that stratgey for rural and urban areas.
Lastly, we should encourage more ride sharing in the urban areas by giving riders discounts. This will allow us to move some drivers to the rural areas so that we can make more money.
